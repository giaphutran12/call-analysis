# Call Center Analytics Pipeline - Revamp Project Summary

## Project Overview
This is a modern revamp of the call center analytics pipeline originally built with plain JavaScript, now rebuilt using Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Original System Analysis
The original pipeline (located in `/ana` folder) is a production-ready system that:
- Processes 6,000+ mortgage broker calls from Net2Phone to Bubble database
- Uses Node.js with plain JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- Has a basic monitoring dashboard with Express + Socket.io + vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Implements a 5-stage pipeline:
  1. Get Call IDs from Net2Phone
  2. Download Audio recordings
  3. Transcribe using AssemblyAI
  4. Upload Audio to Bubble storage
  5. Analyze with OpenAI GPT-4 and upload to Bubble

### Problems with Original System
- No type safety (plain JavaScript)
- Manual DOM manipulation
- No component reusability
- Mixed concerns in architecture
- No build process or optimization
- Poor developer experience (no hot reload, testing, linting)
- Basic UI/UX (no dark mode, poor mobile experience, no data visualization)

## New Tech Stack Setup
Successfully set up modern development environment with:
- **Next.js 15.5.2** with Turbopack
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library (40+ components installed)
- **React 19.1.0**
- **Recharts** for data visualization

- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Command palette (Cmd+K) for quick actions
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Environment Variables Needed
The following environment variables will need to be configured:
```env
# Net2Phone API
NET2PHONE_CLIENT_ID=
NET2PHONE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# AssemblyAI API
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=

# OpenAI API
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Bubble.io API
BUBBLE_API_TOKEN=
BUBBLE_AUDIO_URL=
BUBBLE_ANALYSIS_URL=
```

## Key Decisions Made
1. Chose Next.js App Router over Pages Router for modern React features
2. Selected shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
3. Implemented service layer pattern for API integrations
4. Used TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
5. Separated concerns with clear folder structure
6. Prioritized user feedback with loading states and error handling

## Important Notes
- The original system is still in production and processing real data
- This revamp is being developed in parallel without disrupting the live system
- All sensitive API keys and credentials are kept separate from the codebase
- The new system maintains compatibility with existing Bubble.io integration

## Current Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Stage Components**: Modular, reusable pipeline stage components
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components with consistent theming
- **State Management**: React hooks for inter-stage communication
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design

### Backend Services
- **API Routes**: Next.js App Router API endpoints
- **Service Layer**: TypeScript classes for business logic
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user feedback

### Data Flow
1. User inputs credentials and configuration in UI
2. Stage 1 fetches call IDs from Net2Phone API
3. Call data automatically flows to Stage 2
4. Stage 2 downloads audio files with batch processing
5. Progress and statistics displayed in real-time

## Session Summary
Successfully completed migration of:
- **Stage 1**: Get Call IDs - Fully operational with CSV export
- **Stage 2**: Download Audio Recordings - Batch processing with comprehensive statistics

Both stages are now integrated with data flowing seamlessly between them. The application features modern UI components, full TypeScript implementation, real-time progress tracking, and detailed error handling. The foundation is solid for continuing with Stage 3 (Transcription) migration.

### Key Achievements
- 2 of 5 pipeline stages migrated (40% complete)
- Full TypeScript implementation across all components
- Modern, responsive UI with shadcn/ui components
- Seamless data flow between stages
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Production-ready architecture patterns
